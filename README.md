# governmentsubsidy_blockchain
This project was created in Python using Flask, to ensure transparency in government subsidies using Blockchain.

At every stage of the government subsidy chain, starting from a farmer or manufacturer right to the end user, the data transfer is hashed and put into a block of the blockchain.

Hence, if there is any tampering of prices/quantities at any level, the hash value changes and it is easy to tell where corruption/malfeasance has found it's way into the subsidy chain.

The main Python program is blockchain.py, and it also interacts a localhost web server using Flask. 

Thank you, and enjoy!
